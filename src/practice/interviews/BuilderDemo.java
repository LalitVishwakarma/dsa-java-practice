/**
 * Need of Builder Pattern: Method chaining is a useful design pattern but however if accessed concurrently,
 * a thread may observe some fields to contain inconsistent values.
 * Although all setter methods in above example are atomic,
 * but calls in the method chaining can lead to inconsistent object state when the object is modified concurrently.
 * The below example can lead us to a Student instance in an inconsistent state,
 * for example, a student with name Ram and address Delhi.
 *
 * There is Builder pattern to ensure the thread-safety and atomicity of object creation.
 * Implementation : In Builder pattern, we have a inner static class named Builder inside our Server class with
 * instance fields for that class and also have a factory method to return a new instance of Builder
 * class on every invocation. The setter methods will now return Builder class reference.
 * We will also have a build method to return instances of Server side class, i.e. outer class.
